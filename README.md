# Image-Augmentation-Examples-for-Machine-Learning
The code in this repository shows how to use [imgaug](https://github.com/aleju/imgaug) to create thousands of augmented images for training machine learning models. Image augmentation is a quick way to improve accuracy for an image classification or object detection model without having to manually acquire more training images.

This repository is provided as a reference and example for my talk at the Embedded Vision Summit 2020 conference, [Practical Image Data Augmentation Methods for Training Deep Learning Object Detection Models](https://embeddedvisionsummit.com/2020/session/practical-image-data-augmentation-methods-for-training-deep-learning-object-detection-models/).

Expected completion date for repository: 9/4/20

## Requirements

- Python 3.4+
- OpenCV v4.1.0+
- numpy v1.16.4+
- imgaug (`pip install imgaug` or `conda install imgaug` if using an Anaconda environment)
